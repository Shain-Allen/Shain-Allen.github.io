		<p>World of Color is a Game I made during my Senior year of highschool through a Program called WANIC in a class
			hosted by Digipen. it took place over 4 weeks with a team of 7 (3 programmers, 3 artists, and 1 sound
			designer), where I took up the role of Lead Tech/Programmer.</p>

		<p>the goal of the project was to make a vertical slice of a game where all the features were represented in a
			single small level. it started off with people who had ideas doing pitch presentations, then "hiring" people
			onto their team. Once teams were assembled we continued brainstorming what direction and scope the game
			should have based on what was presented in the pitch presentation.</p>

		<p>the base concept we landed on was a 2D top-down rpg where you are a hero who lives in a world of color and
			art, however, evil entities have descended upon the world to drain it of its color. So using your paintbrush
			sword you must set out into danger and defeat this threat and return color back to the world</p>

		<p>Due to having 3 programmers on the team for such a small project, I had to focus more on leading and
			coordinating instead of making features. However, I did make a few key features of the game such as the
			Shader that controls how much color is in the world based on the remaining enemies, and also was applied to
			represent the player's health by draining the color from their body as you take damage. I also made the
			system that controls the audio mix that allows for more of the instruments to start playing as you remove
			monsters from each area</p>
