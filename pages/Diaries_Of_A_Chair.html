		<p>Diaries of a Chair is a game that I made as part of a team of 5 people over about two weeks and was a journey
			into learning the art of Text adventure games. We used a tool/Engine thatt was purposed built for text
			adventure games called Twine which creates a HTML file based of what you create in its UI designer. Out of
			the box Twine is not a very friendly tool for working in a team as the file that the project gets stored in
			is stored within your browser. you also have the option of downloading a desktop app but the file is still
			comparable to a binary file that is not particularly friendly for Version control. In the end I dug around
			and found out that Visual Studio code had a extention that let you create individual text files that then
			compile to a playable twine game which greatly enhanced our ability to work in parallele and produce more
			content for the game. </p>
